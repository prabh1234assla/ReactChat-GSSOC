- You can create **.env** file in server/ folder to use .env variables
- This .env will be read automatically as `-r dotenv/config` is already added to `npx ts-node` command 
while execution of index.ts file
- Just add your .env file and use the variables. No need to make any new changes for supporting the .env variables
